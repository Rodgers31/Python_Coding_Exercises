# Data Overlap
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª
#
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
#
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
#
# 1
#
# 2
#
# 3
#
# and file2.txt contained:
#
# 2
#
# 3
#
# 4
#
# result = [2, 3]
#
#
#
# IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!
#
# Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

with open("file1.txt") as file:
    num1 = file.readlines()
    print(num1)

with open("file2.txt") as file:
    num2 = file.readlines()

result = [int(item) for item in num1 if item in num2]

print(result)
